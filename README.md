Streamlit is one of the most recent python libraries for powerful dashboard creation and an open source framework for machine learning and data science teams. It can produce industry standard and visually attractive dashboards with very simple coding. I have created a Medical Inventory with interactive visuals and data from a SQL database using streamlit.
