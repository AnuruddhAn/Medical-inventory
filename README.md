Streamlit is one of the most recent python libraries for powerful dashboard creation and an open source framework for machine learning and data science teams. It can produce industry standard and visually attractive dashboards with very simple coding. I have created a Medical Inventory Application with interactive visuals and data from a SQLAlchemy database using streamlit.
                SQLAlchemy is the Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL.
